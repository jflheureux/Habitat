The architecture and methodology focuses on:

* Simplicity - *A consistent and discoverable architecture*
* Flexibility - *Change and add quickly and without worry*
* Extensibility - *Simply add new features without steep learning curve*

For getting started, please check out the [Habitat Wiki](../../wiki).
